# Confinable UI

A demonstration of a confinable UI framework

Builds on ideas from [caputi](https://github.com/danfinlay/caputi), but is more focused on the DOM alternative that it implied but never really dove into.

Also kinda going past the ideas in [react-captp-experiment](https://github.com/danfinlay/react-captp-experiment), by totally abandoning react. This framework could later be ported to JSX if wanted, but it was using very little of the react framework, and I think it shows how lightweight a good ocap framework can be.

Setup:
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`
